        <p1>About this website:</p1> <br> <div id="space_10"></div>
	<p1>This is a bridging day exercise. The instructions are as follows: Create a mini website with at least 4 pages - using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as demonstrated in the lesson resources and flipped learning videos. To comply with this I have created 4 pages. Home, contact, about and FAQ. The bridging day task also requires the website to have a form which I have included in the Contact page. This website also uses css for the styling and javascript for the handling of the input in the contact form.</p1> <br>
